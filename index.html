    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks?</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">To secure your website from web security attacks you can use a server-side web 
        or cybersecurity framework. A cybersecurity framework is a strategic approach that begins with detailed 
        research on security risks and includes activities such as developing a cyber incident response plan, 
        along with suitable application security checklists.  The framework will enable "by default" robust 
        and well-thought-out defense mechanisms against several of the more common attacks such as XSS, CSRF 
        and SQL injections. For example, to protect yourself from a SQL injection you can use Django. It ensures 
        that any user-data passed to querysets is escaped.

        Other attacks can be mitigated through your web server configuration, for example by enabling HTTPS. 
        
        Another important tip is to always check and sanitize all incoming data. A rule of thumb is to always 
        assume the worst. Encourage strong passwords. Consider two-factor authentication for your site, so that 
        in addition to a password the user must enter another authentication code.
        
        Also, there are several available vulnerability scanner tools that can help you find out if you've made 
        any obvious mistakes. You can foe example use Acunetix Vulnerability Scanner. When you have purchased the 
        security measures it is also important to integrate them with your entire environment and automate them as 
        much as possible.
        
        You can also perform security exercises by doing mock attacks to check if your sensitive information 
        is safe. A continuous exercise means that your business is always prepared for an attack. It also helps 
        with maintaining general security awareness.
